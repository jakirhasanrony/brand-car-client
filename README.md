# BrandCar Website
Welcome to the Car Brand Website project! This web application allows users to explore and manage products from six different car brands. Each brand has its dedicated page, and users can view, update, and add products to their shopping cart.

## Features

1. **Brand-Centric Navigation**: The website provides a user-friendly interface where visitors can click on the car brand names (e.g., Lamborghini, Ferrari, etc.) to access a dedicated page displaying products associated with each brand.

2. **Product Management**: Users can view a list of products for each brand, including essential details and images, helping them make informed purchasing decisions.

3. **Product Update Functionality**: Each product card has an "Update" button, which, when clicked, allows users to access a private route for editing product details. After making changes, users can submit the updated product information.

4. **Protected Private Routes**: Private routes for both product updates and product details ensure that only authorized users have access to these functions, enhancing security and data integrity.

5. **Detailed Product Pages**: By clicking the "Details" button on a product card, users can access individual product pages that provide in-depth information about the car model, specifications, and features.

6. **Shopping Cart**: The "Add to Cart" button enables users to add products to their personal shopping carts. A dedicated cart page allows users to review and manage the items they have selected for purchase.

7. **User-Specific Cart**:  Each user can only see their own added products in the cart, ensuring a personalized shopping experience and data privacy.
